# Onboarding Feature

## Overview
The onboarding feature introduces new users to the app through a conversational AI-driven experience that collects personal information to customize affirmations.

## Implementation Details
- Conversational UI with an AI agent
- Progressive information gathering
- Explanation of app functionality
- First affirmation generation
- Notification preferences setup

## User Flow
1. AI agent introduces itself and asks for the user's name
2. User provides their name
3. AI asks the user to share about themselves
4. AI follows up with clarifying questions about goals and challenges
5. AI explains how the app works (check-in â†’ affirmation flow)
6. User receives their first affirmation
7. User sets notification preferences

## Technical Considerations
- AI conversation management
- User profile data storage
- Smooth transitions between conversation steps
- Handling edge cases (user skips questions, provides minimal information)
- Notification permission requests
