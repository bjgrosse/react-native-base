# Login Feature

## Overview
The login feature allows users to authenticate with the application using various methods.

## Implementation Details
- Authentication is handled through Supabase
- Current implementation includes:
  - Email/Password authentication
- Planned support for:
  - Google Sign-In
  - Apple Sign-In
  - Email with Magic Link (passwordless)

## User Flow
1. User opens the app
2. If not authenticated:
   - User is presented with signup page
   - Option to navigate to login page if they have an account
3. User can:
   - Create a new account with email/password
   - Login with existing email/password
4. Upon successful authentication:
   - User is redirected to the main app
   - Session is maintained using Supabase's session management

## Technical Considerations
- Secure token storage handled by Supabase
- Token refresh mechanism managed by Supabase client
- Error handling implemented for authentication failures
- User session management through Supabase's `onAuthStateChange`
