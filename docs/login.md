# Login Feature

## Overview
The login feature allows users to authenticate with the application using various methods.

## Implementation Details
- Authentication will be handled through Supabase
- Support for multiple login methods:
  - Google Sign-In
  - Apple Sign-In
  - Email with Magic Link (passwordless)

## User Flow
1. User opens the app
2. User is presented with login options
3. User selects preferred login method

5. User is directed to the main app or onboarding (for new users)

## Technical Considerations
- Secure token storage
- Token refresh mechanism
- Handling authentication errors
- User session management

## Status
- [ ] Design mockups
- [ ] Supabase integration
