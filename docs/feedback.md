# Feedback Feature

## Overview
The feedback feature allows users to provide reactions to affirmations, helping to refine the AI's understanding of what resonates with them and improve future affirmations.

## Implementation Details
- Reaction options (loved it, didn't work for me, etc.)
- Optional text feedback
- Feedback collection and storage
- AI learning from feedback
- Feedback history view

## User Flow
1. User receives an affirmation
2. User has option to provide feedback
3. User selects reaction type
4. User can optionally explain why (text input)
5. Feedback is stored and processed
6. AI adjusts future affirmations based on accumulated feedback

## Technical Considerations
- Simple, non-intrusive feedback UI
- Sentiment analysis of text feedback
- Feedback data storage and processing
- AI model adjustment mechanisms
- Privacy considerations for feedback data
